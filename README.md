# Tutorials

Hello folksðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ 

In this repository, you will find multiple tutorials to build microservices from scratch. If you are tired of just theoretical knowledge and you have no idea of how things work in real world then, you are on right page. 

### Benefits

It's just fun and nothing else. ðŸ˜› Jokes apart, following are the real benefits.

1. You will gain some practical experienceðŸ§  while building the services.
2. All resources are freeðŸ¤‘, you just have to build stuff on your end.  
3. You will learn some interestingðŸ’™ concepts.
4. You will not just build some simple services but, you will learn to consider every aspect while building services from every angleðŸš’ - scalability, extensibility, maintainability, security concerns, best practices etc.
5. It can help you crack system design interviewsðŸ““ as we will be building HLD and LLD for our services.

# How to follow these tutorials?
All these tutorials are explained in simple language on my [tech blog](https://theweekendbits.wordpress.com/). Following instructions will guide you to start building your own micro-services from scratch.

### User Service
**Objective** - First, we will create a simple user service which can help us register and authenticate a user. Overall goal 
1. **Simple Java based REST API using Springboot** - [Blog](https://theweekendbits.wordpress.com/2022/03/27/tutorial-rest-api-in-java-using-springboot/)
2. **Connecting the springboot api with Redis db** - [Blog](https://theweekendbits.wordpress.com/2022/03/27/tutorial-rest-api-in-java-using-springboot/), [Code](https://github.com/ma5terdrag0n/Tutorials/tree/main/REDIS_AS_USER_DB/demo/demo)
